These scripts allow for the creation, modification, execution and calibration of an HSPF model of the Siletz River watershed in support of the Siletz River Dissolved Oxygen TMDL. 

The HSPF modeling is based on HSPF Version 12.2 - Bicknell, B.R., Imhoff, J.C., Kittle, Jr., J.L., Jobes, T.H., and Donigian, Jr., A.S., 2001. Hydrologic Simulation Program--FORTRAN User's Manual. Aqua Terra Consultants.

The model was constructed and modified based in part on the pyHSPF package created by David Lampert (2015), PyHSPF: Data integration software for hydrologic and water quality modeling. https://github.com/djlampert/PyHSPF.

Calibration was conducted using PEST created by Watermark Numerical Computing, 2018. PEST: Model-Independent Parameter Estimation User Manual, with supporting theory in Doherty, J., 2015. Calibration and uncertainty analysis for complex environmental models. Watermark Numerical Computing, Brisbane, Australia. 227pp. ISBN: 978-0-9943786-0-6 Downloadable from www.pesthomepage.org.
